  <p>Bacon is a type of salt-cured pork[1] made from various cuts, typically from the pork belly or from the less fatty back cuts. It is eaten on its own, as a side dish (particularly in breakfasts), or used as a minor ingredient to flavour dishes
    (e.g., the club sandwich). Bacon is also used for barding and larding roasts, especially game, including venison and pheasant, and may also be used to insulate or flavour roast joints by being layered onto the meat. The word is derived from the
    Old High German Bahho, meaning "buttock", "ham" or "side of bacon", and is cognate with the Old French bacon.[2][3] It may also be distantly cognate with modern German Bauch, meaning "abdomen, belly". [4]</p>
